Renaming apps
=============

You can rename an app at any time with this command:

    $ heroku rename newname
    http://newname.heroku.com/ | git@heroku.com:newname.git
    Don't forget to update your Git remotes on any local checkouts.

Renaming an app will cause it to become unavailable on the old subdomain (oldname.heroku.com) and available on the new name (newname.heroku.com) immediately.  This may not matter if you're using a custom domain name, but be aware that any external links will need to be updated.

Updating the Git remote
-----------------------

You will need to update any git remotes that you have defined in your checkouts after a rename.  Do this by editing .git/config and looking for the lines that look like this:

    [remote "heroku"]
        url = git@heroku.com:oldname.git
        fetch = +refs/heads/*:refs/remotes/heroku/*

Change "oldname" to "newname", then save and exit your editor.

NOTE: If your app has collaborators, you may want to inform them of the name change, so that they can update their remotes as well.
